# Abstraction

Abstraction is a fundamental aspect of how humans think and interact with the world. It allows us to simplify complex realities by focusing on the most relevant aspects, ignoring less pertinent details. This process helps us understand and manage the vast amount of information we encounter. For example, language, mathematics, and models are all forms of abstractions that help us communicate ideas, solve problems, and make decisions efficiently.
